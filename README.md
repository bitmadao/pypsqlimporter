These scripts are based off the coursework for the Udemy course I am currently following to study Python, "Python 3 Complete Masterclass - Solve Real Life Challenges" by Mihai Catalin Teodosiu.
I am grateful to him for putting together a course with several components related to real world uses of Python.

Created first and foremost for me to hone my understanding of coding and such.
